</html>

<!-- This is a boiler plate. Its a starting template for an html page

emmet has autocomplete that allowed for this. There is a lot of emmet autos
input

The html tag says to the browser that anything in the content will be html code.

You can use the file path of the this file to allow the browser to access and
display the page locally.

There are different meta elements but the one above is for the char set.
This is for the utf-8. meta data is associated data.

UTF8 is for the different characters used and contains all the characters for
different languages.

Unicode is similar to UTF8
UTF8 is the best especially if it has international visitors.

UTF8 has all the international symbols.


----------------------

The head and the body are the same heiarchial structure

The em tag italicizes the text and puts data on it saying that you should
emphasize the text.
The i tag is just for styling the text.

Same with bold and strong tag. You can style the color and other att. of
strong and emphasis but not bold and italic

For images you need to specify the source of the image. You use the url for this
You can also put the alternative text for when it cant render.
It has to go through to the servers with the photo info. If it gets permission it will
grab the photo and display it.

If the image is no longer hosted at  the address tahts specified you will get
a box with a red x in it.

You can also refer to a file name in a local folder.

HTML = Hypertext markup language
we talked about the markup but not the hypertext portion

The text documents can be linked together using hyperlinks. You click on a link
and it takes you to another text document

The links have an a tag and a hyper reference to the destination that the link
will take you to. You can put actual text for the link for people to click on
Needed for directing visitors on your site. A # will lead you back to the page
you are on

a is for anchor tag

From hyperlinks you can quickly make lots of pages linked together to build
a quick website rather then just a web page

You can also create tables
Every table has rows
In the rows you have table data

Deprecated means that its downgraded and its no longer reccomended
HTML is for structure
CSS is for styling
Javascript is for behaviour


You can nest tables within each other To create data entries with multiple lines
You can use html forms to collect data from your users
